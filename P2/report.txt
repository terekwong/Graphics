An issue that I got stuck on for the longest time was that I wasn't able to get the fragment shader and vertex shader to work.
To fix this, I had to use another method of doing the fragment shader and vertex shader which was to pass it as var rather than
a const and then I didn't have to use the createShader function that I made in the first program rather I could use the one from
the library. After that there wasn't anything else that really gave me problems as I had some experience using sliders and inputs.

As of now, the only bug that I have is that you are able to enter in plus and minus into the RGB values but it doesn't really affect it
as it just treats them as a value of zero.
