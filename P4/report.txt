There weren't any issues that I ran into.

Through this assignment, I learned how to use the camera and lookat functions.

The only remaining bug is that if there are no inputs for the points and you press the animate button, 
then the program will break and won't work for any inputted points. It require you to refresh the page in order to fix it.
